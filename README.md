# Utilizing-Machine-Learning-for-Predictive-Modeling-of-Company-Attrition
The project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to build predictive models for company attrition. By analyzing various attribute features, such as employee demographics, job satisfaction, performance metrics, and work environment factors, the models can accurately predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the company. 
# Dataset 
The dataset is sourced from kaggle (company_attrition.csv)
# Machine Learning Algorithms
Several machine learning algorithms are employed in this project to develop predictive models for company attrition. These algorithms include:

Linear Regression, Decision Tree ,Random Forest ,Logistic Regression ,Gradient Boosting , Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Each algorithm offers unique strengths and characteristics, allowing us to explore different modeling approaches and evaluate their performance. By comparing and fine-tuning these models, we aim to identify the most effective predictive techniques for accurately forecasting company attrition.
